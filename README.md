# NYT

This minimal responsive news app was styled with bootstrap, and the news articles are populated from the NYT API.

You will need an API key which can be obtained here - https://developer.nytimes.com/

After cloning this repository to your machine, create a config.js file and create a config variable. The config variable 
should be an object with one property, API_KEY, equal to your new key. Be sure to name the file config.js so the current git ignore
will work properly.
