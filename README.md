# NYT

This minimal responsive news app was styled with bootstrap, and the news articles are populated from the NYT API.

You will need an API key which can be obtained here - https://developer.nytimes.com/

After cloning this repository to your machine, create a config.js file which contains a config variable. The config variable 
should be an object with one property, API_KEY, equal to your new key. Be sure to name the file config.js and the variable
config so the current git ignore and app.js file work properly without any changes.
